### Abstract

We would like to change parameter as follows.
- The voting period for the proposal will be changed from 14 days to 3 days.


### Background

The voting period for governance in Panacea is 14 days, which is enough time to discuss the proposal.<br/> 
However, this period is too long to keep up with this fast-paced crypto ecosystem.<br/>
As an example, simple changes in specific parameters for IBC transmission took 14 days, which takes a lot of time to link to Osmosis.

We suggest reducing the voting period for governance to 3 days.<br/>
You may feel that these three days of time do not have enough time to discuss a proposal, but we are preparing to create a community where we can discuss it sufficiently before posting an important proposal.<br/>
We fully discuss important proposals in the community and expect that the three-day voting time will not be a problem if the proposal is posted later.

If you refer to other chains, Terra has recently been changed to 7 days, and Osmosis has a 3 day voting period.<br/>


### Expected effects

- Once the proposal is registered and 10,000 MED is deposited, the voting that starts will be held for three days, allowing quick changes to be applied.
