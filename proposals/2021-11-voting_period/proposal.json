  "description": "### Abstract\n\nWe would like to change parameter as follows.\n- The voting period for the proposal will be changed from 14 days to 3 days.\n\n\n### Background\n\nThe voting period for governance in Panacea is 14 days, which is enough time to discuss the proposal. \nHowever, this period is too long to keep up with this fast-paced crypto ecosystem.\nAs an example, simple changes in specific parameters for IBC transmission took 14 days, which takes a lot of time to link to Osmosis.\n\nWe suggest reducing the voting period for governance to 3 days.\nYou may feel that these three days of time do not have enough time to discuss a proposal, but we are preparing to create a community where we can discuss it sufficiently before posting an important proposal.\nWe fully discuss important proposals in the community and expect that the three-day voting time will not be a problem if the proposal is posted later.\n\nIf you refer to other chains, Terra has recently been changed to 7 days, and Osmosis has a 3 day voting period.\n\n\n### Expected effects\n\n",
