  "description": "### Abstract\nWe would like to change two parameters as follows.\n- Change the community tax from 0% to 2%.\n- Change the minimum proposal deposit from 100,000MED to 10,000MED.\n\n### Background\nCommunity pool can fund those who contribute through governance voting.\nThis community pool will be filled with a certain amount of mining reward as a fee.\nCosmos Hub is using this Community Pool to fund contributors.(https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core/issues/186#issuecomment-927537658). \nPanacea also proposes to be able to fund multiple contributors for better development.\nAlthough the rewards of validator and delegates will be slightly reduced, the raised funds from Community Pool will surely help Panacea's ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, We suggest lowering the minimum proposition to induce active participation in governance proposals.\nCurrently, the minimum cost of registering the proposal is 100,000MED.\nThis is about $6,000, which is not easy for even contributors with good ideas to register proposals.\nSo, we suggest changing it to 10,000MED to reduce the burden of registering the proposal.\n\n### Expected effects\nMining rewards from validator and delegates will be reduced. (About 2%)\nThis fund will be transferred to Community Pool.\nIf the contributor helps the ecosystem of panacea, it can be funded through governance voting.\n\nWhen registering a proposal, the deposit required for the proposal is reduced to 10,000 MED.",
