### Abstract
We would like to change two parameters as follows.
- Change the community tax from 0% to 2%.
- Change the minimum proposal deposit from 100,000MED to 10,000MED.

### Background
Community pool is a means of funding those who contribute through governance voting.
Cosmos Hub is using this Community Pool to fund contributors.(https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core/issues/186#issuecomment-927537658).
Panacea also proposes to be able to fund multiple contributors for better development.
Although the rewards of validator and delegates will be slightly reduced, the raised funds from Community Pool will surely help Panacea's ecosystem.

In addition, We suggest lowering the minimum proposition to induce active participation in governance proposals.
Currently, the minimum cost of registering the proposal is 100,000MED.
This is about $6,000, which is not easy for even contributors with good ideas to register proposals.
So, we suggest changing it to 10,000MED to reduce the burden of registering the proposal.

### Expected effects
Mining rewards from validator and delegates will be reduced. (About 2%)
This fund will be transferred to Community Pool.
If Panacea has a contributor to helping the ecosystem, it can be spend at Community Pool through voting.

When registering a proposal, the cost of fundraising will be reduced to 10,000MED.
