# Proposal to amend inaccurate total supply details

This proposal seeks to amend inaccurate total supply details that have been disseminated on trading platforms and disclosure sites. The context is as follows: during its ICO in 2017, Medibloc initially declared a total token supply of 10 billion. However, with the subsequent launch of the Cosmos SDK-based mainnet, the total supply naturally evolved to be unlimited. Unfortunately, the necessary correction has not been implemented, and we intend to rectify this discrepancy.
- Voting objective: Rectifying the inaccuracies in the total supply information displayed on exchanges and cryptocurrency information websites.
- Inaccurate information: The current total supply of Medibloc coin is, in fact, unlimited, contrary to the 10 billion mentioned on certain sites.

Although community voting is not mandatory for this information modification, we seek to ensure that the entire community is informed and accepts this change through a community voting process.

No action is required from node operators.
