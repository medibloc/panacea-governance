  "description": "For enabling IBC with other Cosmos-based chains, proper client types should be registered to the IBC genesis parameter: 'allowed_clients'. Basically the Tendermint light client must be registered since most of Cosmos-based chains are compatible with the Tendermint light client. Also, we would like to register the Solo Machine light client for future use.",
