  "description": "# Proposal for Comprehensive Communication of Changes Regarding Circulation Quantity and Disclosure Protocol\n\n**Purpose:** This proposal aims to inform MED token holders about significant changes in circulation quantity and circulation disclosure protocol. While community voting procedures typically don't apply to circulation adjustments, this vote is being conducted to enhance community awareness and ensure transparency in communicating project advancements.\n\nSince the inception of circulation disclosure, Medibloc has consistently reported the circulation of MED on exchanges where it is listed, as well as on prominent platforms such as Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. Moving forward, our commitment remains steadfast in preventing market ambiguity, prioritizing the interests of holders, and ensuring the dissemination of accurate circulation information.\n\n## Voting Objectives\n\n1. **Notification of the Planned Liquidation of 500 Million MED in Q1 2024**\n    - Mainly for tax payments resulting from the tax audit conducted in 2023.\n    - Implementation of new business initiatives.\n        - Support for business collaboration with world-class new K-Beauty medical institutions to provide a quality user experience.\n        - Planned special services or benefits for MED holders utilizing the aforementioned medical institutions.\n\n2. **Approval for the Disclosure Protocol of Uncirculated Reserves by Medibloc**\n    - Prior notice to be provided no less than 3 months in advance.\n    - Disclosure of circulation purpose and quantity.\n\nWe appreciate your comprehension and active participation in this voting process.\n",
