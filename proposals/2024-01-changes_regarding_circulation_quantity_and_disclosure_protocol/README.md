# Proposal for Comprehensive Communication of Changes Regarding Circulation Quantity and Disclosure Protocol

**Purpose:** This proposal aims to inform MED token holders about significant changes in circulation quantity and circulation disclosure protocol. While community voting procedures typically don't apply to circulation adjustments, this vote is being conducted to enhance community awareness and ensure transparency in communicating project advancements.

Since the inception of circulation disclosure, Medibloc has consistently reported the circulation of MED on exchanges where it is listed, as well as on prominent platforms such as Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. Moving forward, our commitment remains steadfast in preventing market ambiguity, prioritizing the interests of holders, and ensuring the dissemination of accurate circulation information.
