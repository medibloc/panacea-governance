# Match External Incentives for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pairs


### Background

As established in Osmosis Proposal [#47](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47), the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

MED liquidity pools have been listed on Osmosis since 23 Nov 2021.<br/>
A signaling proposal for promoting MED pools to Incentivized Pools is in its voting period on the Osmosis chain: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/78.


### Proposal Details

This is a proposal to allocate ~$900,000 for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pools on Osmosis to be paid by the MediBloc foundation.<br/>
Also, this proposes for the Osmosis community to launch the Incentive Matching program for MED pools.<br/>
This is beneficial to increase liquidity and most importantly to ensure that price slippage is reduced.<br/>

By voting **YES** on this proposal, external MED incentives will be matched at ~$5,000 per pool per day for 90 days.<br/>
By voting **NO** on this proposal, external MED incentives will NOT be matched at ~$5,000 per pool per day for 90 days.

The MediBloc foundation has prepared 12,370,000 MED which is approximately equivalent to $900,000 based on the average market closing price for the latest 7 days since 19 Nov 2021 (according to the historical data of CoinMarketCap).

**TODO: The exact MED amount is to be determined.**


That total budget will be provided to the following MED pools as external incentives for liquidity provision:
- MED/OSMO (Pool #586): ~68,722 MED per day for 90 days (= ~$5,000)
- MED/ATOM (Pool #587): ~68,722 MED per day for 90 days (= ~$5,000)

All MED used for these liquidity incentives will be matched with an equal value of OSMO incentives if this proposal is passed by the Osmosis community.

These will be split up into the following buckets for each bonding period (**TODO**):
- 1-day bonding: 8,500 MED/day
- 7-day bonding: 25,500 MED/day
- 14-day bonding: 34,000 MED/day
