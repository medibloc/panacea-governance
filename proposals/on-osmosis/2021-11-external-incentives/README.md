# Match External Incentives for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pairs


### Background

As established in Osmosis Proposal [#47](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47), the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

MED liquidity pools have been listed on Osmosis since 23 Nov 2021.<br/>
A signaling proposal for promoting MED pools to Incentivized Pools is in its voting period on the Osmosis chain: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/78.


### Proposal Details

This is a proposal to allocate ~$900,000-worth MEDs for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pools on Osmosis to be provided by MediBloc.<br/>
Also, this proposes for the Osmosis community to launch the Incentive Matching program for MED pools.<br/>
This helps increase liquidity and most importantly ensures that the price slippage can be reduced.<br/>

By voting **YES** on this proposal, external MED incentives will be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.<br/>
By voting **NO** on this proposal, external MED incentives will NOT be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.

The MediBloc has prepared 12,222,725 MED which is approximately equivalent to $900,000 based on the average market closing price for the last 7 days as of 26 Nov 2021 (according to the historical data of CoinMarketCap).

The MED incentives for each MED pool will be the following:
- MED/OSMO (Pool #586): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (\~$5,000 approximately)
- MED/ATOM (Pool #587): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (\~$5,000 approximately)

All MED used for these liquidity incentives will be matched with an equal value of OSMO incentives if this proposal is passed by the Osmosis community.

These will be split up into the following buckets for each bonding period:
- 1-day bonding: 8,488 MED/day
- 7-day bonding: 25,464 MED/day
- 14-day bonding: 33,952 MED/day
